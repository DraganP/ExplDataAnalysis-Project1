I used different methods to create plots between the first two plots (1, 2) and the other two plots (3, 4).

For the first two plots (1, 2), I was able to create the plot on the device (screen) first and then copy it to the PNG file.

However for the other two plots (3, 4), when I tried copying the plots from the screen to the PNG file, they were getting messed up, as mentioned in the lecture. (Quote: "Copying a plot is not an exact operation, so the result may not be identical to the original."). Specifically when I specified the exact plot size (480 x 480) the legend was getting pushed further to the right so only half the text was showing, and trying to change font scaling didn't help.

Therefore for the other two plots (3, 4) I changed the code to create a PNG directly, without first plotting on the screen and then copying to PNG, and that apporach solved the problem.
